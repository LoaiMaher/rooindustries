                Frankly speaking, getting optimized can change how your
                mechanics feel. This can be good or bad depending on how you
                adjust. It helps you feel more consistent but does not improve
                skill by itself ‚Äî practice is still key.

                Optimizations work system-wide for latency. FPS gains vary

                similar averages but much better 1% lows and frame consistency.
